# Help to Grow: Digital
## Department for Business and Energy

## The Challenge
To build in partnership, as part of a multi-vendor team, Help to Grow: Digital. We kicked off in the wake of Covid. The initiative came directly from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

### Help to Grow: Digital
A UK-wide government-backed scheme that aims to help SMEs choose, buy, and adopt digital technologies to help them grow their business. These include e-commerce, accounting, and CRM products.

The Help to Grow: Digital scheme offers businesses:
- Free, impartial advice and guidance about what digital technology is best suited to your business and how it can boost your business’ performance.
- Targeted financial support, if your business is eligible, worth up to £5,000 towards the costs of buying approved digital technologies.

## How we delivered
We assembled a multi-disciplinary team in a multi-vendor environment, including Delivery Management, Product Manager, Business Analysis, Full stack Development, Testing, and Analysis capability. Our Help to Grow Digital Programme delivery manager was accountable for delivering complex, high-risk products and services throughout the product life cycle. Working with the delivery team to define Objectives and Key results, identify and manage dependencies with other teams and workstreams across the Help to Grow Digital Programme, manage agile ceremonies and reporting against progress.

We conducted workshops and 1-on-1s with stakeholders to understand and document business requirements. We managed stakeholder expectations (policy) regarding what can/can't be delivered. Requirements aligned to GDS standards with reuse of services where possible. These requirements were translated into Epics/user stories/Acceptance using INVEST principles / BDD and MoSCoW to prioritise.

Our Agile team at BEIS deployed rapid iterative product developments from epics, features, user stories, and tasks using INVEST criteria. Each user story with acceptance criteria was developed and tested during each sprint; this process includes Creating front-end HTML and CSS, integrating front-end and MVC backend, performing functional testing, creating automation tests, and delivering code to the approach branch for release.
